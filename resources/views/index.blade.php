                        Quite simply put, this is a tiny server applet I wrote in under an hour to demonstrate some quick ways to use Google Vision API. As you can see from the code, it is mostly fairly straightforward - and you're able to achieve a lot in a small timeframe. <br class="mb-3">Feel free to tinker with the code, learn the nuances and be able to come up with solutions geared at helping achieve something great.
