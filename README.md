# Google Vision AI Demonstration App

Google AI Vision is a timesaver when it comes to quickly processing an image, then deriving storable data from it to utilize in your own app in a matter of minutes. The purpose of this demonstration app is to simply get started with the app with minimal development friction.

![Oh look, it's Dang!](demo/GDG_Demo.png?raw=true "An example results yeild by the system.")

## Documentation

Being a hacky demo app, this is meant to be used as a reference to how you can begin making your own apps powered by Google AI vision. I utilized the [Lumen](https://lumen.laravel.com/docs) framework for making this, so please follow their installation guide.

## Presentation Slides?!

Pffft. [Here you go.](demo/slides.pptx). Pay better attention next time!

## Help, it doesn't run!?

First, follow the Laravel/Lumen documentation closely on how to setup the project. Initialize your environmental file, then make sure to generate your own Google Vision AI secret key. I'm not sharing my API secret ;)
